// Package utils provides utility functions and helpers for use within the terratest-utils library.
//
// This package contains reusable utilities for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, handling REST client
// configurations, and other common operations needed in testing and automation scenarios. The functions
// in this package are designed to be used internally by other packages in terratest-utils, as well as
// directly by tests that require advanced or custom behaviors.
//
// Example utilities include:
//   - Retrieving and configuring Kubernetes REST clients based on various options.
//   - Helper functions for working with test contexts and logging.
//   - Common error handling and assertion helpers.
